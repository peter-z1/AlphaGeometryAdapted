# AlphaGeometryRE

AlphaGeometryRE is a re-engineered version of [AlphaGeometry](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry) with a
goal to [make](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/issues/130)
[it](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/issues/116)
[easy](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/issues/96) to use (especially on [Windows](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/issues/120)):

* Use [ChatLLM.cpp](http://github.com/foldl/chatllm.cpp) for LM inference, no Tensorflow/Jax/Flax.

* Significantly **simplified** _requirements.txt_.

* Indent with **four** spaces (🖕 two spaces).

# Solving Olympiad Geometry without Human Demonstrations


This repository contains the code necessary to
reproduce DDAR and AlphaGeometry,
the two geometry theorem provers
introduced in the [Nature 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5) paper:

*<center>"Solving Olympiad Geometry without Human Demonstrations".</center>*

## Get started

1. Get the source code.

    Either clone this repository or download it.

1. Install ChatLLM.cpp DLLs (or .so whatever).

    You can find prebuilt DLLs in releases. Or, you can [build](https://github.com/foldl/chatllm.cpp/blob/master/docs/binding.md#precondition) `libchatllmb` from source.
    Copy these DLLs into `src/chatllm/bindings`.

1. Install Python dependencies.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Optionally, you can create a virtual environment, and then install dependencies into it.

1. Run `run_tests.bat` to check if everything is Ok.

    The language model will be downloaded automatically.

1. Run `test.bat` to solve a IMO problem with the AlphaGeometry solver.

## Command line flags

A list of command line flags.

* `--mode`: solver selection. (default: `ddar`)

    1. `--mode=ddar`: select the DDAR solver.
    1. `--mode=alphageometry`: select the AlphaGeometry solver.

* `--problems_file`: problem file

    Example: `--problems_file examples\examples.txt`.

* `--problem_name`: name of a problem in the given problem file

    Example: `--problem_name orthocenter`. `orthocenter` is a problem in `examples\examples.txt`.

* `--defs_file` & `--rules_file`: definitions & deduction rules.

    Defaults to `data\defs` & `data\rules.txt` respectively.

* `--batch_size`: beam size of the proof search. (default: 2)

* `--beam_size`: beam size of the proof search. (default: 2)

* `--search_depth`: search depth of the proof search. (default: 2)

NOTE: The results in the paper can be obtained by setting
`--batch_size=32`, `--beam_size=512`, `--search_depth=16`.
But, not confirmed yet.

### Example of DDAR

Below we showed DDAR solver solving IMO 2000 P1:

```batch
python src\alphageometry.py ^
  --problems_file=examples/imo_ag_30.txt ^
  --problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p1
```

Expect the following output

```shell
INFO - translated_imo_2000_p1
INFO - a b = segment a b; g1 = on_tline g1 a a b; g2 = on_tline g2 b b a; m = on_circle m g1 a, on_circle m g2 b; n = on_circle n g1 a, on_circle n g2 b; c = on_pline c m a b, on_circle c g1 a; d = on_pline d m a b, on_circle d g2 b; e = on_line e a c, on_line e b d; p = on_line p a n, on_line p c d; q = on_line q b n, on_line q c d ? cong e p e q

036. ∠QEB = ∠(QP-EA) [46] & ∠(BE-QP) = ∠AEP [55] ⇒  ∠EQP = ∠QPE [56]
037. ∠PQE = ∠EPQ [56] ⇒  EP = EQ

==========================
```

The output first includes a list of relevant premises that it uses,
and then proof steps that gradually build up the proof.
All predicates are numbered to track how they are derived
from the premises, and to show that the proof is fully justified.

TIP: Additionally passing the flag `--out_file=path/to/output/text/file.txt`
will write the proof to a text file.

Running on all problems in `imo_ag_30.txt` will yield solutions to
14 of them, as reported in Table 1 in the paper.

### Example of AlphaGeometry

As a simple example, we load `--problem_name=orthocenter`
from `--problem_file=examples.txt`.
This time, we pass `--mode=alphageometry` to use the AlphaGeometry solver.

```shell
python src/alphageometry.py ^
    --problems_file=examples/examples.txt ^
    --problem_name=orthocenter ^
    --mode=alphageometry ^
    --beam_size=2 ^
    --search_depth=2
```

Expect the following output:

```shell

==========================

INFO - Solved.
```

NOTE: Point `H` is automatically renamed to `D`,
as the LM is trained on synthetic problems
where the points are named alphabetically, and so it expects
the same during test time.

As can be seen in the output, initially DDAR failed to solve the problem.
The LM proposes two auxiliary constructions (because `--batch_size=2`):

* `e = on_line e a c, on_line e b d`, i.e.,
`E` is the intersection of `AC` and `BD`.
This construction has a score of `-0.017550`.

* `e = eqdistance e c a b, eqdistance e b a c`, i.e.,
construct `E` as the intersection of circle (center=C, radius=AB) and
circle (center=B, radius=AC). This construction has a lower score (`-4.05149`)
than the previous.

Since the first construction has a higher score, DDAR attempted it first and
found the solution right away. The proof search therefore terminates and
there is no second iteration.
